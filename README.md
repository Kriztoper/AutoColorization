This code attempts to Automatically color grayscale images using CNNs over CIFAR 10 data set.

We have tried modeling this problem as regression with loss l1, l2, huber and classification with rebalancing.
We tried GANs (DCGAN, WGAN) as well. 

You can find source code in folder src/, model  binaries in models/
